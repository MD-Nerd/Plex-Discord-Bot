     CHANNEL_ID=1234567890
     LAST_RUNTIME_FILE=last_runtime.txt
     CHECK_INTERVAL=60
     ```

4. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **Setup**

1. **Plex Server**:
   - Ensure your Plex server is running and accessible.
   - Obtain your Plex Token ([Guide](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)).

2. **Discord Bot**:
   - Create a Discord bot at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Obtain your bot token and invite the bot to your server.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store sensitive data in the `.env` file to keep it secure.

## **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**
| Variable           | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `PLEX_SERVER_IP`   | IP or domain of your Plex server.            |
| `PLEX_TOKEN`       | Plex authentication token.                  |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN`    | Discord bot token.                          |
| `CHANNEL_ID`       | Discord channel ID for sending updates.     |
| `LAST_RUNTIME_FILE`| Path to cache file for the last runtime.     |
| `CHECK_INTERVAL`   | Time interval (in seconds) between checks.   |

### **Runtime Cache**
- The bot uses `last_runtime.txt` to store the last runtime.
- If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
- To reset, delete the file and restart the bot.

---

## **Usage**

1. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The bot will:
   - Query your Plex server every `CHECK_INTERVAL` seconds.
   - Send an embed message for each new media item added since the last check.
